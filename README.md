### 🥼 Who I am 🥼

Currently enrolled in *EPFL*'s Chemical engineering and Biotech master. I am trying to connect the world of biotech with that of energy (i.e. Biofuels)

### 💻 What do I code for? 💻

Often you need to create simulations or models which require computational work to solve in this domain.
